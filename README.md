# Exercises from [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sahilm/go-tour.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sahilm/go-tour)

## Running tests

Tests are run with [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). Please install it
if you don't have it installed. Most OS X and Linux machines should have `make` out of the box.

```bash
$ make bootstrap # will install tools needed to run tests
$ make # runs all tests and checks
```

For more stuff, see the Makefile. Makefile and associated scripts have been adapted from 
[hashicorp/vault/Makefile](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/master/Makefile).
